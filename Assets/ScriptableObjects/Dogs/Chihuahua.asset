  description: The world's smallest dog breed has the largest brain-to-body ratio
    of any canine, making them surprisingly clever and strong-willed. Named after
    the Mexican state where they were discovered, these tiny dogs can live up to
    20 years and often develop fierce loyalty to a single person.
